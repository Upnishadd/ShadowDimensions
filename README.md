# ShadowDimensions

2D game made in Java using Bagel Libraries

The game features two levels : Level 0 is in the lab and Level 1 is in the Over Under. In Level 0,
the player will be able to control Fae who has to move around the walls and avoid any sinkholes
that are in the lab. If the player falls into a sinkhole, the player will lose health points. To finish the
level, the player has to get to the gate, located in the bottom right of the window. If the player’s
health reduces to 0, the game ends. When the player finishes Level 0, Level 1 starts - Fae is now in the Over Under. To win the level
and the game, the player must fight and defeat Navec. However, the player has to deal with more
sinkholes and demons too. The player can cause damage to the demons and Navec when the player
presses a certain key. Likewise, the demons and Navec can cause damage to the player. The player
will also have to move around trees (they don’t cause any damage like the walls in Level 0).
Level 1 will also give the player the opportunity to change the timescale so that the difficulty of
the game can be changed. Pressing a certain key will increase/decrease the speed of the demons
and Navec (this is explained in more detail later). Like in Level 0, the game will end if the player’s
health reduces to 0 or less.
